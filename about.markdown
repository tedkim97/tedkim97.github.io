title: About Me

This is the my blog/portfolio website that I finally had time to during the global pandemic (Everyone has a blog these days so I might as well have my own). This is a dump from all of my current/past work experiences

I'm sorry if this content looks awful on mobile - this isn't really designed for mobile users.

Despite enjoying social media, I don't believe in sharing social media with everyone 

Here are some places you can find me by:  
[Github](https://github.com/tedkim97)  
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-kim/)

## Details about the Site

This site is hosted on github pages using Jekyll as the static site generator. I'm using the [hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
