This is the my blog/portfolio website that I finally had time to during the global pandemic (Everyone has a blog these days so I might as well have my own). This is a dump from all of my current/past work experiences

I'm sorry if this content looks awful on mobile - this isn't really designed for mobile users.

Despite enjoying social media, I don't believe in sharing social media with everyone 

Here are some places you can find me by:

## Details about the Site

This site is hosted on github pages using Jekyll as the static site generator. I'm using the [hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
