# Ergodox Review

I'm writing this review, not because I had a *terrible* experience with the ergodox, but because I've actually only heard **good** things about the ergodox. 

I've heard from my friends/coworkers that the ergodox was good. I've also read online that the ergodox was good, one of the popular tech youtube channels even recommended the ergodox. 

That being said, my experience using the ergodox is "okay" at best - which is "okay", but dissapointing considering the price, compromises, and alternatives.

My problem was not because of the learning curve, or the reconfiguration process, but more fundamental process of a lack of keys, lack of expressiveness, and reliance on layers. 

# What exactly is the source of wrist or hand pain?
Deviations from moving your wrists.


# understanding something about my philosophies
I frequently operate on a "what happens if something goes wrong"


# My history with mechanical keyboards
I've seen a lot (although I have't always been present):
- novelty keys
- slide bars
- box switches

Back when I was a finance wannabe, It was natural for me to use a full sized keyboard, My left hand would be on QWERTY while my right hand was on the numpad, which was comfortble for excel.

Transition into computer science resulted in me using ALPHANUMS more than the numpad. Even though I really like the numpad to type numbers, It was a waste of space for me.

Transition into OPTIMAL typing. I realzied that it got frustrating/slow for me to use my mouse during work, and I've also learned from using VIM that I don't **need** to use my mouse. As a result, I spent all my time on the homerow of the keyboard 


# Warning before purchasing the ergodox
THERE WILL BE AN INTENSE LEARNING CURVE
YOU'LL BE RECONFIGURING YOUR THING A LOT

# Amazing Things
The ergodox has a lot of good points, mainly the thumb clusters and tent kits. 

### Solid Build Quality (and Nice Keys)
The keyboard is a nice plastic build, the wrist pads feel nice, it doens't feel like a cheap project

### Split Layout
The split layout is amazing, and is a clever wya of making keyboards more ergonomic. 

People with two different shoulder lengths will have two different widths that they can type comfortable at. A keyboard that can comfortably do that is a split kyeboard


### Thumb Clusters
thumb clusters are an incredible idea the thumb is really waste on just pressing the spacebar on a traditional layout

- the split factor is amazing. I can use the middle space to right notes, or make more space for something else

- The thumb clusters are a really good idea (albeit, I think their design isn't perfect). It's good because the thumb cluster has really large keys, but the small keys seen a bit impracticable with my hands. 
-- for instance I use the period and comma there
- the side keys are also a good idea


### Tent Kits
- the tent kit
-- beung able to angle my hands in a tent makes more comfortable to type



# Deal Breaking Problems
### Weird Purchasing Configurations (minor)
It's annoying to me that they don't offer a blank option. I apprecite that they've validated a decent enough variety of keys, but ultimately as someone who has a lot of mechanical key switches, it's annoying that I can't use my own from the get go. Ultimately a minor complaint 

### Unergonomic/Gross Modularization
From my experience, it's difficult to use the ergodox without the tent kit and wrist pads

### Awkward Thumb Clusters (minor)
The thumb clusters are a bit weird to use in their intended purpose, mainly the keys in the bottom left and bottom right. They're too small to accurately use with my thumb, and also too far for me comfortably clic with my thumb

### not enough keys

"But there are less keys because you're supposed ti be able to reach keys from your hand". One of my friends says that your hands should never leave the homerow of the ergodox. I think he was right, but in it's incredibly difficult for me to reach some of they keys. 

I seem to be on the shorter end of the hand sizes for the ergodox then. 



### keys aren't a problem because you have layers
I have 3 60% mechanical keyboards, so I'm VERY familiar with layers. Layering is good, but they are an incredible fail prone solution.

If you haven't used the keyboard in two weeks, or need to press a key that you don't use as frequentl, suddenly you have to press random combinations of keys or look at your keymaps, or the svreenshot of the configuration you took. It's workable, but you're making more work for yourself.

### Ortho linear keyboards are not magic.
I honestly don't even like them. If your hands are angled upwards to prevent [ulnear] deviation, there is even less reason to like them... You're just shooting yourslef in the foot with this keyboard layout.   

I repeat: ortholinear is not magic. 


When you first play a stringed instument you play with your fingers straight, but after observing experts, you noticed that their fingers are slanted. 

This is the same for typing. You don't need to type with perfectly straight fingers, and as a result having a perfectly ortholinear fingers is terrible. 


If you've played a stringed musical instrument, you might understand the concept of "slanting" your fingers to reach more notes and play more comfortably. 


### good wrist ergonomics. terrible hand ergonomics. 

I get the impression that the ergodox was built for people with slightly bigger hands. My hands are constantly straining outwards in order to reach every key of the alphanumeric thing (which is not ergonomic).

"Why not just shift your hands on the keyboard then". This will be able to help. 

### Terrible Return Costs

The "cost" of tring out an ergodox is expensive. According to their website https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/return-policy

costs around $90.

# What isn't a valid critique of the ergodoc
- the layout is hard to get used too. Of course it's going to be difficult to adjust to
- the cables - yes they suck, but that's not really the point,
- switch selection. The switch slection on the ergodox is pretty terrible. However the board has "hotswap" inserts, which allows you to take out switches with different ones without the use of a soldering iron. I generally dislike hotswap boards, nut it's nice that the option us there.

# the number one flaw is that is lacks keys
While this sounds 

The problem is that because my hands are small, I can.t use the keyboard effectuvely. As a result my hands are always fucking strained

# the split design makes it incrediblt comfortable to type at the right distances apart

# I don't want my keybiard to be the thing that takes up my time
I love mechanival keyboards (I really do). I have spent a god awful amount of money on keyboards.

I thought that I would love this keyboard because it's QMK configurable and infinitely adjustable. 

### Other Notes

IRONICALLY MY WRISTS HURT AS MUCH AS BEFORE

# Alternatives?

I highly recommend Kineses Edge Advantage (Gaming version of not). 

Even though the RGB makes my eyes bleed (you can turn it off), and the right hand side of the keyboard is *annoying* to get adjusted to, but it's not.
