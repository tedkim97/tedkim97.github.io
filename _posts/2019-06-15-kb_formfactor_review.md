I was an impressionable child, and I was enthralled with how all my favorite pro-gamers used "mechanical keyboards". After using a mechanical keyboard, I was impressed with the feeling of using one, and I really enjoyed the "click" they made (although you can't really live with/near anyone if you have a lcicky mechanical keyboard).

As a result, I was ***really*** into mechanical keyboards, and I regret not spending the money on more productive endeavors like stocks and bonds. 

Mechanical keyboards have gone from an incredibly niche hobby, to a more mainstream topic. 

Even though the patent on Cherry MX switches have expired and there has been an introduction of quality alternatives (outemu, kailh, zealpc, gateron) - people still drop a lot on mechanical keyboards.

# Review Specifications
I will only review formats that I've *actually* used - as a result it's not a full-on review. 

# Ergonomics
As I got older, I realized that the ergonomics of keyboards actually mattered too as well.

Definitely the chepaest board to get into, with a very common size so there's a lot of ways to get into the hobby. 

# 60% (with arrow keys)
At the expense of having a non-standard left shift, you can get the small form factor of a 60%

The annoying part is that there are two extra keys on the main layer that don't really serve a purpose. 

Still the lack of function keys is annoying

# 75%

# Tenkeyless no numpad

No numpad, but keep the function row. 


it makes using my mouse a bit uncomfortable sometimes, in addition to being almost impossible to carry around. 

# Full Sized
It's always nice to have a numpad and a dedicated funciton row.
