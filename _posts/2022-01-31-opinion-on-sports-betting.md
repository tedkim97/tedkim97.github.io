# Disclaimer - this is strongly out of my fields of expertise and this blog post is going to be more about opinions, I strongly recommend you to do more research on this topic before coming to conclusions



As an individual (that is fairly removed from Sports and Trading), I find the rising popularity of sport betting platforms a bit odd. 

However, after reading this [NYTimes Article on Sports Betting](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/sports/football/super-bowl-sports-betting.html), I've realized we're witnessing a large rise in sports betting. 


I don't really follow sports and I have almost no exposure to market making/prop trading. However, it is increasingly difficult to ignore sports gambling advertisements (DraftKings, Caesars Spotsbook, https://www.gamingtoday.com/sports-betting/) and increasing popularity of sports analytics positions[^1].

[^1]: Here is [SIG](https://www.sig.com/sports-analytics/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=01192022-sigcom-sports-analytics-et&fbclid=IwAR212ep7-d6HyMVis-tZCQ8H9GxXMA4bUmDWksQAg4lmgW5b1iqUvN2XAHg) 




what's weird - is the increasing popularity & marketing for *sports betting*.


As an outsider, I thought these sports analytic firms were a bit ridiculous becaue I didn't understand *why* they existed. However, after doing some research and asking around I've discovered the insidious nature of htese firms.



I have small understanding of gambling and probability to know that I do not have the edge to consistently win, and winning is a fools errands. But I also understand that there is a demand for gambling and the current regulatory landscape makes me uneasy, but not outright devasted.

# People *want* {Gambling}
Often times when vices like these (Alcohol, Smoking, Gambling, etc) come up, there is a counter argument that people *want* these things.
- People do not drink, smoke, or gamble *solely* because of marketing, but because these are enjoyable activities. External regulation and moral outcry will just cause blakc markets for these.

- I agree

-- However, the increasing profitability from Sports Betting makes me think that its cute.   

# The House Always Win
An important detail to understand about casino games is that they're designed to have the house win. A competent designer, will set the payouts of their games so that they have a small edge against you in the long run. 

- A simple example is [Rouletee - where you lost a hay-penny on each bet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette#Bet_odds_table).

- A decent amount of people think that if you consistently win a game, you can turn a profit. But in reality, a casino could make a game where the player wins 90%, and still make money in the long run. For example,  the casino would give the payout of 9:10. As a result, the expected value you get from betting $100 is $85.5. Over the long run you're steadily losing $14.5 dollars per game. (Obviously - no one would play this game, but a lot of casino games add layers of complications that distract from this fact)



[1] :You hear these famous cases where teams will coordinate plays to win against the casino with games like blackjack. One thing to note is that the casino can (legally) make you leave if you're winning too much and,  (2) provide tables with much worse blackjack odds.










# Conclusion

To me its a bit predatory.
- Similar to the situation where Robinhood would feed ends of trades into wolverine trading and citadel


I understand that trading firms in this situation are providing "liquitity" to people who want to gamble
- But this situation gives a weird emphasis 

You could argue this weird tongue in cheek "this is capitalism" and that they're providing value to people that demand this good, but I'm still going to think you're a massive prick when you're selling tap water for $5 an ounce.
