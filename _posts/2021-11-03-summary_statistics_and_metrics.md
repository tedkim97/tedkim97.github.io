: Descriptive statistics is often contrasted with "statistical inference" which focuses on valid generalizations from data - i.e taking a small portion (sample) of all possible data (population) and generating conclusions about the population. It's important to note that inference involves quantifying uncertainty when estimating the population, relying on probability and models to come to the conclusion.

# Introduction 

I thought I would continue with a summary of descriptive statistics, and some random tangents like "metrics and (TODO) measurability.

My goals isn't to list summary statistics and their formulas, but to demonstrate the nuance and decision making necessary for creating descriptive statistics, and the broader practice of describing data. 

# What are Descriptive Statistics?
The textbook "Statistics" defines "descriptive statistics" as the "art of summarizing data"[^1][^2]. Descriptive statistics should communicate as much information about data as simply as possible - i.e reducing the cognitive load of thinking. [The wikipedia definition is pretty much the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics).

[^2]: Now that I have grabbed definitions from respectable resources - I'm just going to rely on wikipedia.

A table of Descriptive statistics often comes with several [summary statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_statistics) (a single number summarizing a large amount of data[^2]) or [visualizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization).

## Why do we need descriptive statistics?
Inference is the main part of statistics people "care" about - often times people don't care about  

While there are overlapping formulas/calculations between summary statistics in both descriptive and inference statistics (variance/std, mean, median, etc), descriptive statistics aren't used for inference.  


So why should we care about descriptive statistics?

1. Brevity (They are fast & comfortable summarizes) 
- Is important for summarizing data - most people won't have the time to comb through the data as you did.

Instead of looking at all your logs or visualizing the distribution, you can just have a 1-2 descriptive statistics to get an idea about the shape of your service. 

(EXAMPLES HERE)

but it's a balancing act.

One or two descriptive statistic will rarely communicate a complete picture about the series, but it will provide context 

2. Context
- They don't have intuition for your domain, as a result summary statistics are a great way of establishing context
- Anomly detection & stuff

3. They guide and inform decisions about what kind of tests we should use and run 
- The standard deviation of our data is so large, any kind of inference we draw from it would be useless 

- In [my previous blog post]({% link 2021-07-21-latency_measurement_stats.md %}), summary statistics and visualizations of our latency distributions guide us into the types of distributions we should use to model our inference (predicting the probability of certain slow cases). 

## What are the components of Descriptive Statistics?

Fall my understanding the components of descriptive statistics fit under two categories: summary statistics and visualizations. 

### Summary Statistics

Some examples of summary statistics are averages, correlation, IQR ranges, measurement, error, median, etc

average(s); correlation; interquartile range; measurement
error; median; percentiles;
regression effect; r.m.s.;
SD; slope"

### Visualizations

Visualizations are another important component of descriptive statistics as well.

The reason visualizations are so important is because 

Summary Statistics isn't (always) enough - we need Visualizations.


#### Why do we need visualizations?
In my undergrad I naively thought, "what is the point of data visualizations" - can't we just use summary statistics to understand.

I was very wrong.


A famous example of proving this point wrong is anscobme's quartet. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet


The Autodesk team have demonstrated a pretty awesome of anscombe quartet version of this with data as well

called the Datasaurus Dozen

Research paper on how they did it
https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/www/autodesk-reasearch/Publications/pdf/same-stats-different-graphs.pdf

Here's a youtube summary of it
https://youtu.be/DbJyPELmhJc

#### Back to types of visualizations

scatter plots, histograms for data;  normal curve;

Scatter plots are another kind of 

# The Case Study

Using our newfound knowledge of descriprive staitstics, which numbers should we use?

## Let's say you need some dashboard in Datadog, New Relic, Splunk, etc

## Measuring how well the data fits does this the statistic fit  Is this an accurate number? (It Depends)
Depending on what our data looks like the "correct" summary statistic you use could differ. 

If our data looks something like this:

{% assign caption1 = "Sample histogram generated with numpy & matplotlib" %}
{% include caption_image.html imgpath="/figures/distribution_figs/measuring_latency_simple_histogram.png" alt="small example of histogram of latencies" caption=caption1 %}

or this

Completely flat distributions (although there is probably something seriously wrong if your data)

then using mean and standard deviation are perfectly fine.

## Dealing with Skew

But what happens if your data looks like this?
**Incredibly skewed distribution**
Very clearly most of your data occurs between X and Y ms, but because of your outliers the average is very unrepresentative of your day.
- As a result you might pick median results or percentiles to characterize your data

### Tangent: Income statistics
Income is one of the most popular examples of choosing median income vs average income.


In this graph provided by the [federal reserve](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N#0) we see that mean income is almost $20,000 in the late 2020's rather than the median income, why is that?

<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=GjGm&width=670&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

The reason is how these numbers are calculated. The median takes the value at the 50% - which is unaffected by the actual dollar amount each household earns.

However, the average accounts for the dollar earned. When individuals earn an extraordinary small or large amount of money, they can drag the number down or up.


# Tangent: Be careful about what you are **really** measuring

## Path lengths can affect code execution (and other seemingly trivial things)

https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ozytw8/why_two_identical_methods_run_at_different_times/h86klch/

https://twitter.com/badamczewski01/status/1423683244264988672?s=12
- This isn't a problem specific to rust or .NET as well. I saw a conference talk on proposed tool for measuring execution time of programs by varying path lengths. The presenter gave a background how they discovered path lengths could lead to different execution times depending on the machine it was run on.

Are you measuring the implementation of an algorithm, or are you measuring the performance of an algorithm after optimized by compilation, or with a hardware accelerator, etc. 

Here's a story that you might here. 

Ah here's the benchmark on the remote server, and here's my new feature promising 100x speedup on my local branch. I've benchmarked with several runs (n= 1000000) and I've also varied the inputs.
- I've shown the minimum, maximum, median, average, std, IQR runtimes, and it shows that I have 10x speed up with the same amount of std

- Is this correct?

## SonarQube Metrics

## Averaging Color

I made a whole blog post "critique" about someone using average colors and interpolated frames to represent color usage in movies, but that just isn't realistic

# Tangent: Metrics

Since this is a software context - something we need to mention are "metrics"

Metrics (by themselves) don't really involve any statistics. There might be statistics *around* metrics i.e how correlated is X metric with Y

To be honest, I don't have a formal definition for "metric" aside from a system of measurement. 


It was one of those word I picked up in my undergrad career from nonprofit consulting, and my working understanding just "worked" in other applications in my life.

My working understanding is that it is a quantitative measures meant to be used as proxies/indicators of more abstract concepts.
i.e "user engagement" might be a combination of likes, comments, shares on $SOCIAL_MEDIA_PLATFORM
i.e "velocity" in the agile framework may be quantitatvely measured as number of Jira tickets or "Story points" completed in a period of time - but is meant to represent the productivity of the team.

I don't have many favorable opinions of "metrics"

## Some metrics feel completely meaningless/misleading

## Often time there's an audible groan whenever "metrics comess up"

## Metrics tend to degrade over time
