# Introduction

I'm not a video game designer or even a pro player. I don't really have the time to play video games anymore, but I'll watch a couple of pro games on youtube if don't have anything better to do

Although I (was) a very enthusiastic Starcraft, Hearthstone, League of Legends, Borderlands 2 player. 

I can still get Diamond in SC2 (although I just proxy 2-rax, 3-rax, go outdated buikds )

I would only say that I'm good at getting "decent" at a video game (not amazing).

These are transcriptions/updates to some old notes I had on video game balance. I apologize for the lack of citations as I was "living" competitive balance history as I was growing up.


**Disclaimer**
I am by no means "right" - balance is tricky. However, I wanted to lay some groundworks and metrics to establish *how* we can think about balance in competitive games

In addition, I like to supplement my writings with research or statistics (I hate facts/claims that don't provide sources) to provide verification. However, this blog will be from personal experiences. 

# The Two Thoughts to Game Balancing: Slow and Fast

Just like they're two popular philsosphies in economic policy (a strict supply-side approach, and a keynesian "stimualte" the econmoy approach) - game balancing has also gotten a "slow" and "fast approach".

The slow method is to allow the players to develop strategies to beat the currently "imbalanced" things

The fast method is for game designed to patch the game to nerf/buff (weaken/strength) certain aspects of this game to fix this problem.

# Starcraft Brood War: Perfect Balance

I think a lot of the game designers at blizzard (maybe not as much in the recent years) think back to the 7 years of perfect game balance that starcraft broodwar had.

The game has had an incredibly long and complex history - and more importantly, the game hasn't received a balance update in years.

How did Starcraft broodwar survive for so long?

In the first couple of years of Hearthstone, It seemed that content updates came

Now I *feel* like Hearthstone.

I'm not making observations on my emotions, but I seem to notice a more frequent

# Remembering that using a single metric is never good

If history has ever told us anything, using a single metric to describe how well you're doing is awful. 

From an economics perspective, it can change (and has) changed the behavior of individuals [teachers examples]

# Trying to balance from structure

# Trying to balance from statistics

# Remembering that balance is ultimately about PEOPLE

# I think that the key issues around balance is the idea of what's "Fair"
The community may agree on a set of key philosophies that should be **true** in a balanced game.

**A better play will always win**
**Players should still be able to have fun**


# The idea of "Agrresion", "Greed", "Goodness", "Badness", and "Punishment"

I'd argue that it's really easy to climb any competitive game is by recognizing "mistakes" and being able to punish them.


# I propose the balance should be approaches from a structual perspective
