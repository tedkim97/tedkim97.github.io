Here is my opinion on opinions.

I also tend to have very strong opnions on the littlest things, causing clashes over the littlelest things
- it's not to the point where  It's unproductive or clashes with style, but I also die a little inside 

People share opinions a lot - especially with the advent of social media. Ironic because I too am oversharing my opinion 

Depending on the context, having strong opinions really feels like a "lose lose"
- hanging out with a firend and you say "damn tat fucking sucked" "oh but I really enjoyed it"
- hanging out with a SO "damn that movie really sucked" "oh but I rally enjoyed it :("

In other contexts, your supervisors only want your opinion unless it reinforces their beliefs - and you can lose out if your opinions frequently clash
- I think we're overengineering this thing "you're totally right - this guy is management material"
- I think we're overengineering this thing "you're wrong and my opinion of you is now much lower"

-- Of course you could provide evidence of these materials, but as some other people notice that might not be the case.
