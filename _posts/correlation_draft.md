# Introduction 

Practical Statistics hurrayyyyy

I dreaded doing this one because I'm not confident in my knowldege of it - I'll try my best to not teach you anything wrong, but I'll give a sample of the breadth out there. 


[Here's a relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/552/)

# You can't conclude causation from correlation 


## How can you prove causation?
Experiements - or very convincing data 

# Let's say you need some dashboard in Datadog, New Relic, Splunk, etc

# Is this an accurate number? (It Depends)

# Are you measuring what you really thinkg you're measuring
