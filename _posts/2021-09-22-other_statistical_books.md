While looking through [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28574811), [I read this post about an statistic handbook for engineers created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm). While I haven't gone through every single page (and I'm not sure about the applicability of everything), it's incredible because it's organized from a "practical" perspective and well indexed (although I think it would be nice if they grouped these links more). Furthermore, the book even comes with a dated changelog!

In a similar vein, there's this [pdf called "applying statistics"](
https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1110/ML11102A076.pdf) which I assume is written by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Committee (by the title in the PDF and the fact that it's from nrc.gov). I've only skimmed the index, but this reminds me of the statistics textbooks I used for HS/college, but it could be a great source because the NUCLEAR regulatory commission has it on their site!

Although these sources bum me out because it obviates a lot of the effort I made in my two blog posts about practical statistics :(
