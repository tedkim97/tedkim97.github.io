# TL:DR & Disclaimer: 
Working with chocolate is s urprisingly complex and expensive.

This is NOT a recipe or a guide. Just technical documentation and observations I've had through while making a custom chocolate bar. Use this to judge out what you need to do!

# Context
My dad's birthday was coming in a month, and I was inspired by a [video about making custom chocolate bars](https://youtu.be/O5SwGr-84c4). The chocolate in the video looked like this: ![fig1](/figures/chocolate_fig1.png){: .center-image } 

My dad really likes sugar, so a custom chocolate bar seemed like a great birthday present! I thought this would be simple, but my experiences making this chocolate bar has been unbelievably complicated and painful.

# Requirements

1. The Chocolate Should Be High Quality 
- The chocolate has to taste good (in chocolate standards)
- It'd be silly investing time and energy to only re-gift a Hershey's chocolate bar).
2. Relatively inexpensive 
- I'm willing to drop a decent amount of money for this birthday gift, but I'm not going to spend hundreds of dollars 
3. Classy - the chocolate bar should look professional.
- The chocolate in the linked video looks good, but I feel like it's missing a fancy flair.
4. [Optional] Finding a repeatable process

# The Platonic Ideal

A good chocolate bar should be **tempered** which is chocolate after going through a special process of heating, cooling, and reheating.  

I assumed good chocolate was melted chocolate that was reformed into a mold. I believed if you used good, expensive ingredients, you would get good, expensive chocolate. Similarly, if you melted a good, expensive chocolate into a mold, you would get a good expensive chocolate. 



# Sourcing Chocolate

Some chocolate companies will use vegetable oil as a fat in their chocolate bars instead of cocoa butter. 

This is a way of saving money as cocoa butter is a very expensive ingrdient. 

# Creating A Mold

[Professional services](https://tomric.com/custom-sculpting/) that create custom chocolate molds and packaging exists! The problem is that they're geared towards professional clients, and are too expensive for a hobbyist.

##### Laser Cutting Wood

### Various Silicone Rubber/Mold Making Approaches


Oddly enough, I had a difficult time getting my hands on some of these materials. I lived in a major city (Chicago), so all these other resources should have been accessible. 

However, there does exists services that shipped putties/liquids for creating food molds. At the time I was stingy because the shipping costs were so high, and I

In retrospect, I should have just swallowed


### Thermoforming Mold

(Inset the definiton/explanation of thermoforming)

The University's art center (with a thermoforming set-up) was closed for the summer

The youtube channel had a Makyuu FormBox (which is just a mini-thermoforming machine) - if I wanted to get one, I would have to drop around $700 for one.

There are guides about making Vacuum Forming/thermo forming machine at home, where the power and quality could be much higher for the same price .

I did not have the time, resources, or space to do that in the 2 weeks I had. If you're curious here are some resource 

[D.I.Y Thermoforming 1](https://youtu.be/DWWq2hH7imA)
[D.I.Y Thermoforming 2](https://youtu.be/Tugr2juVWuk)
[D.I.Y Thermoforming 3](https://youtu.be/Gx66mS7U2vY)

Luckily I found a hacker space that had the Makyuu thermoforming machine. 

I went through a huge effort of validating whether polycarbonate is food safe, and easy to use for thermoforming etc. Then I bought a few sheets of poly carbonate on amazon. 

The polycarbonate that I purchased online didn't match could not reach the proper molding temperature of the makyuu machine (the machine didn't get hot enough).

Finally, I had to use some of the food safe sheets that came with the package, but I couldn't find any information online if they were food safe (aside from the copmanies website...)




# Tempering Chocolate

Tempering chocolate is a pretty interesting science. 

A chocolate is tempered when the cocoa butter is predominantly one of the six possible crystal forms. 

Tempered chocolate look shiny, have a solid texture (a *snap* when you break it), and melts in your mouth.

This is also why when your chocolate bar melts and you try to save it buying freezing it, the bar melts in your hand and has a weird texture. The heat melts all of the crystals, and when the chocolate refreezes the sub ideal crystals reform. 

[^1]

If I can't temper chocolate in the first place, how am I supposed to be able to get seed chocolate?

I'd have to buy another bag of fancy chocolate (which was unlikely).


# Seeding Method
One of the most popular techniques for tempering chocolate is the "seeding method"

# Sous Vide

# Double Bowl Method

# Marble Method

# Results
The end result looked good and tasted good!

However, the tempering was a failure

In retrospect, I should have taken more steps to evaluate how I was spending money and quickly scrape certain ideas (like *needing* to thermoform the chocolate bar) after a few road blocks.

I told my dad I spent around $50, but including transportation costs, acqusition of materials, membership fees it came up to a $200.

There are plenty of useful

In Conclusion, Chocolate is stupid

Next time I would experiment with the buying cocoa butter and trying to form seeds

In addition, I would love to get my hands on cocoa nibs and make chocolate from scratch. 

I completed goal 3.

I half succeeded with goal 1

and goal 2 was absolute faiure.

Next time I'll start with the expectation that I'd spend a lot of money
