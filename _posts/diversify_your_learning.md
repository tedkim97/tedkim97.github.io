# Background

As a programmer, I get asked by kids I've tutored, classmates, acquittance a question like "how should I learn to program".

I've thought about this frequently enough, and had a reasonable chunk of experience for me to come to a more "mature" opinion. 


And just like every adult in the world of social media, I feel to thrust this opinion in everyone's face. 


## Separation of "Programming" and "Software Engineering"

I've met people who vehemently state that you don't need a college education to learn programming - that if you're sufficiently smart, you could learn on your own. 
- And yes, to be fair a lot of the things I've learned in my undergrad  


**You don't need university or courses to start learning how to program**, but my university experience can elevate your craft to a much higher level.  
-- Being forced to use debuggers has made me better at using debuggers in professional environments

## Dunning-Krueger Effect

I've been beaten so far into the ground, I'm reasonably sure I'm not a god-tier programmer.

My strenghs as a SWE come  

# Learning Programming "DIY" vs College Education

I grew up praising Google search as a source of truth. When I was young and impressionable, Google search did a great job of answering questions like "how to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit", "how to solve a quadratic equation", etc. A natural consequence was that I believed everything I needed to learn could be through a site on google or a youtube tutorial. 


I was influenced into thinking that the only way I could learn programming was through the results of google and youtube tutorials. 

I would learn how to program by completing "codingbats", tutorials on youtube programming games in Java, etc. 


I would even laugh and think "I don't need to learn C++ from a book - I can just learn on the internet!". 


I appreciate the experience because this process taught me how to struggle through problems, develop fluency, source information, and debug by myself. 

But in retrospect, I've realized this way of learning has *terrible* pitfalls.  


# You can help yourself better once you develop Fluency 
Developing fluency as an outsider is incredibly difficult

Even more strange is the semantics we give to words and acryonyms. 


# My experience learning CS at University

As a diclaimer, I don't think you *need* to study Computer Science at university to become a professional software engineer (a lot of the stuff I use on the job was never taught in class). 

One of the best things about learning at University was the experience of mentorship. 
- While not all classes were helpful, being able to get immediate feedback about your learning experience greatly accelerates learning.
- Furthermore, it's more difficult to learning things "incorrectly"
- Experience breadth for different things

# Depending on the program - university forces you to learn breadth and depth

# Safe space for Mentorship
One of the most valuable things about learning to program is mentorship. This isn't specific to university and 

Having an individual with experience who shares the same context as you, who can answer questions can greatly accelerate your learning (without the painful learning process of DIY). 

"Why do we have feaure toggles"
- If we discover that a new feature isn't working incorrectly, instead of having to re-provision and re-deploy all the software, we can just modify the config file an rebuild in prod
- Depending on the region of area, some features need to be turned off/turned off. That way we can configure different software versions without having to change the code. 

"I messed up X thing in git, how do I recover"
- You can see the operations your mentor uses to learn what to do correctly/incorrectly.



# Kudos to the great online resources

Despite "critiquing" learning on the internet, I believe that the internet has made learning more accessible for the masses. 

There truly are some great learning resources
- 

Come to a great appreciation for textbooks: (Really love textbooks). But just because something has been created as print doesn't mean that it's good. 

Every unit of knowledge in a wikipedia article is cited.
