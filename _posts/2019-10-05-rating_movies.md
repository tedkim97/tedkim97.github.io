# Introduction / Why Ratings Exist 

When we think of a "rating", we tend to think of some metric that represents the quality of something like a movie, song, or game (product if you're an avid shopper). 


The problem with ratings describing media is that we automatically imagine them as "objective" because we're used to metrics describe objective measures (weight, volume, speed, etc).


Naturally, you might think of "movie" ratings as a metric for the quality of the movie. 

This might seem fine superficially, except that when we rate media, we're describe a the **subjective** quality of the media rather than an objective one (something that can be verified by everyone).

This definition might seem fitting at first, but the problem is that the "quality" of the movie is subjective. You can't measure quality of a movie when a ton of people have different opinions on how to do that. 

In reality, movie ratings are not metrics, but a way of communicating information about the quality of the movie.

The reason why I bring this up is because no one wants to read a 20 page article discussing the merits and flaws of "The Emoji Movie".


A lot of people will havbe different ways of communicating their "rating" - whethere it's a letter grade, star rating, number rating. 

### The ways ratings are used
"Should I watch"
"Opinion Validation" - Maybe other people don't do this (but I certainly have).
"Dick Measuring"

I like to categorize reviews in two buckets: One dimensional metrics, and multi-dimensional metrics. 

# One Dimensional Metrics
These measures capture the whole experience of watching a movie script, acting, cinematography, directing into a one-dimensional 

### Like vs Dislike
PRO: Clear - you either like or dislike it

CON: Not very distginuishing, doesn't provide intra-good/bad contra disctions
ex: you don't like the same movies in the same ways. 

### Ratings (/100)
Terrible. There's nothing more I hate than multiplying. Just because there are more numbers/values, doesn't mean that there is increased granularity. 

Provides an unrealizable amount of precision between different movies (i.e this movie X is 2 points better than movie Y).  
Provides an (almost) arbitrary/inconsistent distinction between people.

Out of "100" scores really only work for aggregate reviews (which to be fair is how they occur).

Very sensitive to "review bombing"

### Ratings (5 star)
Much clearly - provides the ability to compare 3 star vs 4 start
Furthermore, half values (3.5, 2.5)

CON - Still doesn't provide good intro comparison
Although this doesn't apply to just 5 star reviews or movies, but faces a weird skew. 

This XKCD (although it's for amazon product reviews) demonstrates potential falls with aggregate reviews

### Letter Grades
I actually think letter grades reflect

### Like/Dislike

### Recommend and Not Recommend
Overwhelmingly Positive
Very Postive
Positive (few reviews)
Most Positive
Mixed 
Mostly Negative
Negative (few reviews)
Very Negative
Overwhelmingly Negative


### Cinema Sins
Way of tallying how "bad" a movie is
These tend to be problematic because you just end up watching the movie in the process.
In addition, these movies tend to be overly critical and cringey. 

# Multi-dimensional Metrics
PRO: Gives the audience the ability to make comparisons

### Rating the attributes of how well it succeeds in the genre movie

### Rating Acting/Cinematograpghy/Compoistion/Color
More nuanced, but also more work. 

Most of the time I feel like someone would be confused, and evaluate a movie to 



### Actual Quality vs Enjoyment
A youtuber described this as his 
I think this was a great way of capturing the q

Clean enjoyable way 

it seperates the quality of the movie (i.e something to satisfy critics) with how it is to actually watch the movie (i.e normal people)

### Watching Alone/Watching Together

Watching Together part is a good metric for measuring how easy it is to watch with freinds and have banter - similar to the "Ironic enjoyment metric"



### Critic Enjoyment, Audience Enjoyment 

I actually 

I enjoy it because I can guess movies that might appeal to hardcore movie enthusiasts (read snobs) but also regular movie watchers


### Conclusion
In conclusion, picking the right metric depends on who you're trying to communicate to.

If you're trying to communicate your complex nuance about the complicated nuance of a piece of media, you shouldn't picking a one dimensional metrics
