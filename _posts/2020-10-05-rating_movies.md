# TODO: 
LOOK AT OTHER MOVIE REVIEWERS ON YOUTUBE
LOOK AT HOW OTHER MOVIE SITES CALCULATE THEIR REVIEW SCORES (metacritic, rotten tomatos, fandango)

# Why Movie Ratings Exist 

Traditionally, when we think of "metrics" we think of measuring. We might measure something by its weight, volume, speed, etc. 

Naturally, you might think of "movie" ratings as a metric for the quality of the movie. 

This definition might seem fitting at first, but the problem is that the "quality" of the movie is subjective. You can't measure quality of a movie when a ton of people have different opinions on how to do that. 

In reality, movie ratings are not metrics, but a way of communicating information about the quality of the movie.

The reason why I bring this up is because no one wants to read a 20 page article discussing the merits and flaws of "The Emoji Movie".

# One Dimensional Metrics
These measures capture the whole experience of watching a movie script, acting, cinematography, directing into a one-dimensional 

### Like vs Dislike
PRO: Clear - you either like or dislike it

CON: Not very distginuishing, doesn't provide intra-good/bad contra disctions
ex: you don't like the same movies in the same ways. 

### Ratings (/100)
Terrible. There's nothing more I hate than multiplying. Just because there are more numbers/values, doesn't mean that there is increased granularity. 

Provides an unrealizable amount of precision between different movies (i.e this movie X is 2 points better tgab movie Y).  

Provides an (almost) arbitrary 

### Ratings (5 star)
Much clearly - provides the ability to compare 3 star vs 4 start
Furthermore, half values (3.5, 2.5)

CON - Still doesn't provide good intro comparison
Although this doesn't apply to just 5 star reviews or movies, but faces a weird skew.

# Multi-dimensional Metrics
PRO: Gives the audience the ability to make comparisons

### Rating the attributes of how well it succeeds in the genre movie

### Rating Acting/Cinematograpghy/Compoistion/Color
More nuanced, but also more work. 

Most of the time I feel like someone would be confused, and evaluate a movie to 



### Actual Quality vs Enjoyment

Clean enjoyable way 

it seperates the quality of the movie (i.e something to satisfy critics) with how it is to actually watch the movie (i.e normal people)

### Watching Alone/Watching Together

Watching Together part is a good metric for measuring how easy it is to watch with freinds and have banter - similar to the "Ironic enjoyment metric"



### Critic Enjoyment, Audience Enjoyment 

I actually 

I enjoy it because I can guess movies that might appeal to hardcore movie enthusiasts (read snobs) but also regular movie watchers
