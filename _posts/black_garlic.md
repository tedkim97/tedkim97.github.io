# A Warning: 
Making Black Garlic takes a long time (if you want to do it the traditional way).


# Introduction
There are a ton of sources on how to make black garlic. Oddly enough, all of these tutorials approach cooking black garlic in different ways, and get almost identical results. When I first was trying to cook, I wasn't sure what I could and couldn't change. 

Now after practicing a couple of times, I can tell you making black garlic is **very easy** and flexible - no need to sweat the details. 

I've hear descriptions that black garlic is incredibly "umami", but I was imagining a stronger, more sophisticated garlic flavor. 

Everyone was doing it and it's the new trendy thing. Black garlic is good, but to be honest the experience is underwhelming. 

I don't see myself using black garlic to replace regular garlic in any meal of sorts. 

It's definitely not worth the price tag. 


Apparently there are claims for a "6-8" hour black garlic, cooked in an instant pot. I have yet to recreate the results, but I have not really confirmed them myself. 


After some experimentation, I realized it doesn't really matter. As long as these things are plugged in, they should work. 


# Type of Garlic Matters

# The Science Behind Black Garlic

Carameliation 
Maillard Reaction - heat, sugar, and amino acids


You might think that Garlic just consists of fibers and sugars, and that amino acids are just associated with meat. 

maillardization



For example this research paper tells me that black garlic is formed by fermenting garlic, but a bunch of youtubers tell me that it's a product of the maillard reaction. 

140 F (celsisu equivalet) is also the temperature the allyenase becomes disabled

### Health Benefits
I'm sure black garlic is healthy, but I doubt that it's the superfood that peopel claim it ot be

# The Core Idea
You're heating garlic in a controlled environment, for a long time. 

### Maillarization
Some people say that the process of turning garlic into black garlic is "fermentation", but in reality the process is more of "carmaliztion" or "maillardization"


### To Wrap or Not to Wrap
There are people who wrap their garlic in these tutorials. I always mix my batch of black garlic of 1/3 in tin foil and saran wrap, and 1/3 just tin foil, and 1/3 by itself. 

I **personally** taste no difference (in flavor or texture) between the two. 

### How long should I cook it?

Brad (from it's alive) mentions 6-8 weeks

From my experience 2 weeks with my rice cooker has worked pretty well. 

### Precision doesn't matter
A lot of foods I've experienced cooking can be specific when it comes to the process/recipe (bread, ice-cream, chocolate). 

Not evaluating the recipe to a realistic degree 


The margin of error for black garlic is fairly forgiving. You could under or overcook garlic, but the consequences aren't super dire.

### How long does it last? 
A decent time I've eaten black garlic 4 months after I've cooked it. 

# A Warning
Try to do this outside, No matter how much you wrap the garlic, it will leak garlic smell into your apartment. I LOVE garlic smell, but my roommates/neighbors probably aren't as enthusiastic.

If you don't have access to an outlet outoodrs/outdoors space, you could place it in the oven with ventilation for 3-weeks (not recommended because then you won't be able to use your oven).

# Heating the Garlic

### The Rice Cooker Method



### Why does the rice cooker method work?
I remember being very shocked that the rice cooker method working.

Often when I try to recreate/reproduce tutorials on the internet, something almost always goes wrong. I was expecting the results of this black garlic tutorial to completely fail because there might be differences in our rice cookers or cooking conditions in our environment. 

Why does this hack/heuristic work?

**This process works because cooking rice is a very specific process**

### The "Proofer Method"
I am all about accurate measurements, precision, and recreation. However, I don't think it's worth buying a bread proofer to do this. 

While the proofer method might make the "perfect" black garlic, the rice cooker method will get you 90% of the way there at a fraction of the price.
