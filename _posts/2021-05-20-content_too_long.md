# Introduction

I've reviewed the posts on this blog, and I noticed that everything is **too long**. Some are "short and sweet" ([debugging some numpy]({% link _posts/2020-12-06-numpy_image_inversion_debug.md %}) & [CUDA acceleration application]({% link _posts/2021-03-04-cuda_barcodes.md%})), but others are way too long ([movie vis]({% link _posts/2020-06-12-movie_vis_presentable.md %}) & [gait recognition]({% link _posts/2020-03-28-gaitkeep.md %})). 

There's nothing wrong with having "too much content", but the problem lies when the readers 
- get bored and don't finish 
- can't differentiate between what's important and unimportant
- think you're trying "too hard"

The length problem also affects me where:
- The length creates a huge burden for myself & editing/proof-reading becomes much more complicated
- It takes 3-5 weeks worth of time to write about any non-significant amount of work
- organization & clarity becomes a mess

The nature of my blog posts differ from some of my other favorite blog posts [ex 1](
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/05/20/i-could-rewrite-curl/), [2](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/05/01/architecture-astronauts-take-over/
), [3](https://www.nayuki.io/page/free-small-fft-in-multiple-languages), but these posts are great because they're easy-to-read, concise but make strong points. 

# Takeaway
I think I will either chunk up future content (i.e part 1, 2, 3), or just cram details (that I need to share, but are not relevant) into some appendix.
