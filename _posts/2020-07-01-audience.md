# TL;DR
*People should write with an audience in mind and use this audience to help focus their content. This is solid advice that helped me a lot in my undergrand carer; however, if I write solely for other people, the process feels empty. After compromising on what I've wanted to write about (for my entire life), I've realized I should write for myself (i.e the most important audience is me)! For once, I want to create content that **I** want to see.*

<!-- Although this process isn't exactly recruiter/resume friendly...*  -->

# Thoughts on "Writing for an Audience"
A piece of advice I have gotten (and seen on the web) is some variation of **"write for your audience"** - the idea being that writers should tailor their content (depth, tone, etc) to fit people that would read their work. This piece of advice was transformative, and it helped guide me on details and explanations I should and shouldn't include in writing or presenting. 

This might mean we **should not**:
- Use slang in a formal presentation
- "Dumb down" technical details to experts
- Throughly cover technical details to people that don't need it
- Teach neural networks to babies[^1]

The most salient example was when our intern supervisor critiqued a "industry primer" for cryptocurrencies. When reading the technical breakdown of cryptocurriences, she said "I promise you that the people won't read this and don't care... You got to remember who you're writing this for". Although it was disheartening to hear in the moment, she gave critical advice. A potential investor doesn't care enough about the proofs in cryptography, consensus mechanism, distributed systems, etc; they're more likely to care about the upsides and downsides with cryptocurrencies. On the other end, you shouldn't be re-explaining fundamentals of any field to seasoned experts - they're already familiar with the fundamentals (by being experts) and you're just wasting their time. 

### But who is my audience?
When I started compiling content for this blog, I got stuck on the question "who is this for?" However, thinking about this advice is a lot more difficult - when making a blog, who should **I** blog to? The popular advice on the web is to "build a portfolio blog" to *yadda yadda yadda*. I had a notion that I wanted to display the past works I've done, but I struggled to lock down the specifics for writing content. 

If I were...
- showing a technical explanation - I would include details of the procedures, documented results, clear citations, etc. 
- If I were trying to sell something, I would be creating some end-product to try to impress someone.  
- Narrating to a friend, I'd probably skim details and focus on the emotional aspects of a project - along with any frustrating issues or problems that popped in the middle. 

If I tried to include all of theses - the end "product" would be a mess, and no one would be happy. Should I blogging for my peers, technical recruiters, potential supervisors, or do I just write for myself?

# Understanding what I want
Some aspects I enjoy are the iterative problem-solving/discovery. Where they narrate steps to reach the project goal, and describing any issues (and solutions) they've found on the way. In addition to the narration, I've always enjoyed completeness/a variety of experiments performed to achieve a better solution in stack overflow posts or research papers. 





I'm a picky guy

Understanding the difference of what you how you want to write/what you want vs what your audienec wants to read. 

I want to write articles that document/note the intiricaies and details of certain topcsi - while an audience member might not just read it

AIM OF MY ARTICLES: 
I try my best to have focused articles


I want narration, I want to see what the person producing this final product had to suffer through to get it done! I want a completeness, in understanding their motivation, why they made certain decisions, and any limitations they ran into.

The "final product" is the only observable piece of effort, and releasing it without an accompanying piece feels sad because the other 99% is just ignored. 

** Thinks I noticed about myself **
I like narration
I enjoy being able to see/read the trial and error process 
I love it when tricky/unconventinal problems have a "clever" aspect to them (think [project euler](https://projecteuler.net))


In my writing, I like to reflect the learning process that I've had (especially if I'm writing a post from notes). When I'm doing/learning something completley new, I am also learning from scratch - and my blog post reflects that.

I realize that I make the assumption that the audience knew nothing - like me.


### I want a dissection of options/exploration of choices in a narrative manner

A Chocolate Blog

# Case Study: A Tutorial On Web Scraping
I wanted to compile all the little fragments and pieces of information I had to acquire 

*because there was no clear comprehensive resouce on web scraping*

# Understanding what your audience wants != What you want

I think it's a lot easier to write about something that fits your audience, the more dis-impassioned you are. 

It's hard to exclude content that **you** think is interesting, but your audience probably **doesn't**




# Conclusion
I **WANT** to write for myself, and I think I will.

Not every blog post will be tailored to the same person.

A blog is for my **personal** expression, and what kind of content I want to see on the internet. If I really needed a portfolio blog for a job (hopefully not ), I would delete large chunks, and just paste them on medium/towardsdatascience.
