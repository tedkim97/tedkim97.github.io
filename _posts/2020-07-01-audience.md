I'm a picky guy

Understanding the difference of what you how you want to write/what you want vs what your audienec wants to read. 

I want to write articles that document/note the intiricaies and details of certain topcsi - while an audience member might not just read it

AIM OF MY ARTICLES: 
I try my best to have focused articles
