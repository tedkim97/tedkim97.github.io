# Introductions & Time Before Microservices

LOCAL/DEV/INT/STG/PROD



# Microservices can be tough 
- Complicated service dependencies make things like unit testing or integration testing non-trivial.
- For instance, in order to test on a "local" environment, you end up having to spin up 12 differnt containers with random downstream dependenceis. 
The headache of testing with microservices is tough because everyone use th

# The Zen Of Microservices

While debugging through an set of orders - I realized there were some bugs that couldn't be reproduced "locally" because its dependencies couldn't be "mocked".
- I.E Some downstream service (like Authentication, Payment, Data) is highly sensitive to the environment you're in 


However, what if you only took a few portions of the service locally, and hook them up directly into the cloud? 

# Mock vs Real Data
Whie it's fine to use mocks & staging environments to test code - sometimes unexpected or inconsistent behavior will leak into the services (random details generated by HUMANS) - the source of pain: the people actually using your software

## Un realistic problems occur because you
