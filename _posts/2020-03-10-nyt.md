I was really in the video, they featured in the [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/technology/alexa-jamming-bracelet-privacy-armor.html)... I was an actor for a demo of a wearable microphone jammer - I'm the guy in the blue shirt (fun fact - I had to wear the blue shirt to cover up a minions t-shirt underneath)!

I was a RA for [Professor Lopes](http://plopes.org/)'s HCI lab at the time, and they just needed an actor to talk and demonstrate the jamming capabilities of the device. I also participated in a user study with the wearable jammer, and I was impressed with how well the device worked. All four of us (the participants) would have a continuous conversation, and the recorded audio was unrecognizable. 

The wearable jammer was a collaboration between the [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/) and [Sand Lab](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago. I'm not going to just re-explain the contents of the article, so feel free to read it on the [NYT website](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/technology/alexa-jamming-bracelet-privacy-armor.html). If you want a better understanding of how the device works - I highly recommend reading the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376304)!

I think both lab's research are interesting, and I really recommend reading some of their other research such as [Trigeminal-based Temperature Illusions](https://lab.plopes.org/published/2020-CHI-trigeminal.pdf), [Preemptive Action: Accelerating Human Reaction
using Electrical Muscle Stimulation Without
Compromising Agency](https://lab.plopes.org/published/2019-CHI-AgencyEMS.pdf), or [Latent Backdoor Attacks on Deep Neural Networks](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/pbackdoor-ccs19.pdf)
