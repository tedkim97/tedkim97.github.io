I was an actor for a demo of a wearable microphone jammer - I'm the guy in the blue shirt (fun fact - I had to wear the blue shirt to cover up a minions t-shirt underneath)!

I was a RA for [Professor Lopes](http://plopes.org/)'s HCI lab at the time, and they just needed an actor to talk and demonstrate the jamming capabilities of the device. I also participated in a user study with the wearable jammer, and I was impressed with how well the device worked. All four of us (the participants) would have a continuous conversation, and the recorded audio was unrecognizable. 

The wearable jammer was a collaboration between the [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/) and [Sand Lab](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago. I'm not going to just re-explain the contents of the article, so feel free to read it on the [NYT website](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/technology/alexa-jamming-bracelet-privacy-armor.html). If you want a better understanding of how the device works - I highly recommend reading the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376304)!

I think both lab's research are interesting, and I really recommend checking some of their other papers out.
