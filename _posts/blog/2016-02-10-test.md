# A Warning: 
My experiences experimenting with chocolate was surprisingly complex (and expensive). This is just some documentation/narration of my experiences trying to make a custom chocolate bar. If you're interested in making your own chocolate bar, I recommend reading to get an idea on moving forward. 

# Context
My dad's birthday was coming in a month, and I was inspired by a [video about homemade custom chocolate bars](https://youtu.be/O5SwGr-84c4).
