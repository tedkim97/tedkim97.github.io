I'm a software engineer at McDonalds. I attended undergrad at the University of Chicago with a B.A in economics and computer science with a specialization in machine learning. 

My interests are in leveraging machine learning for increased automation capabilities, software documentation and reproducibility (i.e statistics), impractical visualizations, and understanding media through data science techniques.

# About this Site
This is a combo of a side-project/educational/opinion blog that I update in my free time. This might include side projects, notes and write-ups from my past activities, work, and research. Minimal javascript (except for latex, d3, imgur linking, and google analytics when needed). I write these posts for completeness - meaning that their might be redundancies depending on your expertise. 

If you have a really large monitor, I recommend keeping your window at half width.

### How is this hosted?
This site is hosted on github pages using Jekyll as the static site generator, and using a modified [poole/hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for the website.
