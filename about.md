## About Me
I am currently a (incoming) systems engineer at McMaster-Carr. I completed undergrad at the 
University of Chicago with a bachelors of arts in **economics** and **computer science** with a specialization in machine learning.

I'm interested in applying machine learning to simple problems for increased automation capabilities, and understanding media through data science techniques.  

## About this Site
This is my dual blog-portfolio site that I finally had time to do during Covid-19 (everyone has a blog these days so I might as well have my own). This is a dump from all of my past work experiences. I'm sorry if this content isn't great on mobile - this isn't really designed for mobile users.

I try to not upload content that already exists on the internet (5 numpy tips!! How to do a linear regression!!) unless I can add significant value to it

You can check out my [Github](https://github.com/tedkim97) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-kim/).

### Details about the Site

##### How is this hosted?
This site is hosted on github pages using Jekyll as the static site generator, and using the poole/hyde theme for the website. 

##### Why the color?
Because I have awful tastes
