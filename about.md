## About Me
I am currently a systems engineer at McMaster-Carr. I completed undergrad at the University of Chicago with a bachelors of arts in economics and computer science with a specialization in machine learning. Outside of work, I'm interested in applying machine learning for increased automation capabilities, and understanding media through data science techniques. 

## About this Site
This is my dual blog-portfolio site that I finally had time (everyone has a blog these days so I might as well have my own). This is an aggregation of notes and write-ups from my past experiences and research. I try to not upload content that already exists on the internet (ex: these 5 numpy tips will blow your mind!! How to do a linear regression!!) unless I can (try) to add value to it. I updated these notes for completeness and correctness - meaning that their might be redundancies depending on your expertise. There might be some overlaps (maybe subset) between the more "Technical Content" and "Fun Stuff" because I think they aren't mutually exclusive!


If you have a really large monitor, I recommend keeping your window at half width.
