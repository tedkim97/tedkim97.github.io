I am currently a systems engineer at McMaster-Carr. I completed undergrad at the University of Chicago with a bachelors of arts in economics and computer science with a specialization in machine learning. 

Outside of work, I'm interested in machine learning for increased automation capabilities, silly visualizations, and understanding media through data science techniques. 

If you're interested, you can check out my [Github](https://github.com/tedkim97) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-kim/).

# About this Site
This is my dual blog-portfolio site that I update in my free time. This contains complete aspects of my side projects, notes and write-ups from my past activities, work, and research. Minimal javascript (except for occasional latex, d3, and some imgur linking).

I try to not upload content that already exists (ex: numpy tips, how to run a linear regression) unless I can add value to it. I write these posts for completeness - meaning that their might be redundancies depending on your expertise. The "Technical Content" and "Hobbies" post tend to overlap because some of these projects tend to be my hobbies!

If you have a really large monitor, I recommend keeping your window at half width.

### How is this hosted?
This site is hosted on github pages using Jekyll as the static site generator, and using the poole/hyde theme for the website.
