## About Me
I am currently a systems engineer at McMaster-Carr. I completed undergrad at the University of Chicago with a bachelors of arts in economics and computer science with a specialization in machine learning. Outside of work, I'm interested in machine learning for increased automation capabilities, silly visualizations, and understanding media through data science techniques. 

## About this Site
This is my dual blog-portfolio site that I finally had time (everyone has a blog these days so I might as well have my own). This is an aggregation of notes and write-ups from my past experiences and research. I try to not upload content that already exists on the internet (ex: these 5 numpy tips will blow your mind!! How to do a linear regression!!) unless I can (try) to add value to it. I updated these notes for completeness - meaning that their might be redundancies depending on your expertise. The "Technical Content" and "Hobbies" post tend to overlap because some of these projects tend to be my hobbies!


If you have a really large monitor, I recommend keeping your window at half width.
