Over my career, I've learned the importance of delivering software that balances the requirements and economics of projects such as backwards compatibility, delivery speed, maintainability, and reliability. As I maintain, work with, and retire "old" software systems, I've become passionate about documentation, reproducibility, and performance/reliability testing. 

My interests are in leveraging machine learning for increased automation capabilities, programming with customized hardware, software documentation and reproducibility (i.e statistics), impractical visualizations, and understanding media through data science techniques.

# About this Site
This is a combo of a side-project/educational/opinion blog that I update in my free time. This might include side projects, notes and write-ups from my past activities, work, and research. Minimal javascript (except for latex, d3, imgur linking, and google analytics when needed). I write these posts for completeness - meaning that their might be redundancies depending on your expertise. 

If you have a really large monitor, I recommend keeping your window at half width.
