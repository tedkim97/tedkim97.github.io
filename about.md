## About Me
I am currently a systems engineer at McMaster-Carr. I completed undergrad at the University of Chicago with a bachelors of arts in economics and computer science with a specialization in machine learning. Outside of work, I'm interested in applying machine learning to (relatively) problems for increased automation capabilities, and understanding media through data science techniques. 

## About this Site
This is my dual blog-portfolio site that I finally had time to do during Covid-19 (everyone has a blog these days so I might as well have my own). This is a dump of my notes from my past experiences and research.  

I try to not upload content that already exists on the internet (ex: these 5 numpy tips will blow your mind!! How to do a linear regression!!) unless I can (try) to add value to it. I try to upload posts for completeness and correctness - meaning that their might be a lot of redundant bits.  

You can check out my [Github](https://github.com/tedkim97) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-kim/).

### Details about the Site

##### How is this hosted?
This site is hosted on github pages using Jekyll as the static site generator, and using the poole/hyde theme for the website. 

##### Why the color?
Because I have awful tastes
